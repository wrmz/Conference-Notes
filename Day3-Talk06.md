## Takeaways

- Design the _right_ thing
- Design the right thing _well_

---

### Separate Required Function (What) from Implementation (How)

Do not get deeply into implementation at the start. If you do, you fail to see the broader scope and miss better solutions.

As an analogy, consider what one would look for in a relationship (for kicks & giggles):

| Function | Implementation |
| - | - |
| Attractive (to me) | Tall, dark |
| Entertaining, fun (to me) | Funny |
| Stable/Prestigious | Rich |

- __Function (What)__ _What you shouldn't be talking about_
  - Search
  - Redundant
  - Link
  - Remote
  - Multiple
  - Window
  - Host
  - Mobile
  - App
  - Button
  - Portable
  - Cloud
  - Page
  - Dropdown
- __Implementation (How)__ _What you should be talking about_
  - Available
  - Durable
  - Pleasant
  - Performant
  - Scalable
  - Affordable
  - Accessible

### Abstract Your Requirements

Analogy:

> When considering a design for a faucet, you may be tempted to design immediately around __temperature__ and __volume__. But what you really want to consider is __comfort__ and __pressure__. Once you solve _that_ abstraction, you can begin determining how best to translate that into temperature and volume.

### Track Your Assumptions

1. Write them down
2. Compare lists
3. Question them
4. Disrupt them (What in this list wasn't a constraint?)
5. Disprove them (Maybe that's not the right answer)

### Introduce Constructive Constraints

> Sometimes we need a little (creative) constraint, because the world is infinite.
> \- Danielle Applestone

Dropdowns are bad UI. Most of the time you shouldn't be using them. Try an exercise where a better solution to dropdowns are discovered.

### Pursue Bigger, Better Boxes

Designers don't think "out of the box". If they think in new ways, they've only just made their box bigger.

The bigger and weirder the box, the better it is. Diversify the thinking with other perspectives.
