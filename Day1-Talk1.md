# [Mapping Experiences: From Insight to Action](https://www.slideshare.net/Kalbach/mapping-experiences-oreilly-design-conference-2017)

__Speaker__: James Kalbach, Header of Customer Success at [MURAL](http://mural.ly/), authored _"Designing Web Navigation"_ & _"Mapping Experiences"_

## Takeaways

- Start with customer experience and work backward toward the technology - not the other way around.
- Create abstraction to align with the broader customer and make data digestible.
- Find value where the individual experience and organization provision align.

---

### Alignment Diagrams

Diagrams that visually align customer experience to the organization provisions. They don't provide answers. They are only meant to draw interest and foster conversations. Answers come from the resulting discussions. Recognize that experiences aren't always chronological. Sometimes they're hierarchical.

- __Customer Journey Maps__
  - Focus: 3rd person experience as a Sheetz customer
  - How does this customer fit into our world?
  - Individual :arrow_right: Interactions :arrow_right: Organization
- __Experience Maps__
  - Focus: 1st person experience as a customer
  - How does Sheetz fit into the customer's world
  - Interactions :arrow_right: Individual :arrow_right: Organization
- __Service Blueprints__
  - Focus: How to provide an experience to a customer
- __Mental Model Diagrams__

### Workflow

- Initiate (Make it Relevant)
- Investigate (Make it Real)
- Illustrate (Make it Visual)
- Align & Envision

#### Initiate: Make it Relevant

Define the right problem - mapping helps give context from which to zoom in or out of where to focus efforts. This is useful to transition focus in meetings - however do __NOT__ go into a meeting with an empty board. Steer project owners to the correct problem.

[] Point of View (Whose/which experiences?)
[] Focus (Focus on which elements?)
[] Scope (What is the scope of the experiences?)
[] Structure (How should the diagram be structured?)
[] Usage (What should the diagram be used for?)

Business care about __growth__. Align to these business goals:

- Increased revenue
- Decreased cost
- Increased new business
- Increased existing business
- Increased shareholder value

#### Investigate: Make it Real

1. Gather existing sources
  1. Qualitative
  2. Quantitative
2. Interview internally
  1. Sketch the experience (together!)
  2. Identify knowledge gaps
3. Interview externally
  1. Contextual interviews
  2. Surveys (quantitative data)
