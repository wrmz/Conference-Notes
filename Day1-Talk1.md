__Speaker__: James Kalbach, Header of Customer Success at [MURAL](http://mural.ly/), authored _"Designing Web Navigation"_ & _"Mapping Experiences"_

## Takeaways

- Start with customer experience and work backward toward the technology - not the other way around.
- Create abstraction to align with the broader customer and make data digestible.

## Value

Find value where the individual experience and organization provision align.

### Alignment Diagrams

Diagrams that visually align customer experience to the organization provisions. They don't provide answers. They are only meant to draw interest and foster conversations. Answers come from the resulting discussions. Recognize that experiences aren't always chronological. Sometimes they're hierarchical.

- __Customer Journey Maps__

Define the right problem - mapping helps give context from which to zoom in or out of where to focus efforts. This is useful to transition focus in meetings - however do __NOT__ go into a meeting with an empty board. Steer project owners to the correct problem.

### Workflow
