# [Mapping Experiences: From Insight to Action](https://www.slideshare.net/Kalbach/mapping-experiences-oreilly-design-conference-2017)

__Speaker__: James Kalbach, Header of Customer Success at [MURAL](http://mural.ly/), authored _"Designing Web Navigation"_ & _"Mapping Experiences"_

## Takeaways

- Start with customer experience and work backward toward the technology - not the other way around.
- Create abstraction to align with the broader customer and make data digestible.
- Find value where the individual experience and organization provision align.

---

### Alignment Diagrams

Diagrams that visually align customer experience to the organization provisions. They don't provide answers. They are only meant to draw interest and foster conversations. Answers come from the resulting discussions. Recognize that experiences aren't always chronological. Sometimes they're hierarchical.

- __Customer Journey Maps__
  - Focus: 3rd person experience as a Sheetz customer
  - How does this customer fit into our world?
  - Individual :arrow_right: Interactions :arrow_right: Organization
- __Experience Maps__
  - Focus: 1st person experience as a customer
  - How does Sheetz fit into the customer's world
  - Interactions :arrow_right: Individual :arrow_right: Organization
- __Service Blueprints__
  - Focus: How to provide an experience to a customer
- __Mental Model Diagrams__
  - Individual :arrow_right: Interactions :arrow_right: Organization
- __Ecosystem models__

### Workflow

- Initiate (Make it Relevant)
- Investigate (Make it Real)
- Illustrate (Make it Visual)
- Align & Envision (Make it Actionable)

### Initiate: Make it Relevant

Define the right problem - mapping helps give context from which to zoom in or out of where to focus efforts. This is useful to transition focus in meetings - however do __NOT__ go into a meeting with an empty board. Steer project owners to the correct problem.

- [ ] Point of View (Whose/which experiences?)
- [ ] Focus (Focus on which elements?)
- [ ] Scope (What is the scope of the experiences?)
- [ ] Structure (How should the diagram be structured?)
- [ ] Usage (What should the diagram be used for?)

![POV, Scope, Focus, Structure, Usage](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/mappingexperiencesoreillydesignconfpresentation-170321034534/95/mapping-experiences-oreilly-design-conference-2017-45-638.jpg)

Business care about __growth__. Align to these business goals:

- Increased revenue
- Decreased cost
- Increased new business
- Increased existing business
- Increased shareholder value

### Investigate: Make it Real

1. Gather existing sources
  1. Qualitative
  2. Quantitative
2. Interview internally
  1. Reach people as high as you can go
  2. Sketch the experience (together!)
  3. Identify knowledge gaps
3. Interview externally
  1. Contextual interviews
  2. Reach people who interact with customers as well
  3. Consider workarounds they may be incorporating
  4. Surveys (quantitative data)

### Illustrate: Make it Visual

![Analyze Data](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/mappingexperiencesoreillydesignconfpresentation-170321034534/95/mapping-experiences-oreilly-design-conference-2017-60-638.jpg)

Analyze the data and find the patterns. Use an aggravate view (not individuals at a single level). Sometimes the pattern is that there is no pattern. Research will conflict - expect that. When this happens, go up a level of abstraction.

| Guideline | Example 1 | Example 2 |
| - | - | - |
| __Start with insights__ | Research cluster 1: People indicated they sometimes hesitate and reconsider during the customer acquisition phase because of our premium pricing model | Research cluster 2: There is a clear pain point around deploying the solution, primarily due to lack of necessary technical knowledge |
| __Use natural language__ | People reconsider when making a purchase because they may be nervous or anxious about the high cost | Users struggle to install the software for the first time if they don't have the required technical skills |
| __Keep voice consistent__ | I reconsider when making a purchase because I'm anxious and nervous about the high cost | I struggle to install the software for the first time because I don't have the necessary technical skills |
| __Omit pronouns and articles__ | Reconsider when making purchase due to anxiousness and nervousness over high cost | Struggle to install software for first time without the necessary technical skills |
| __Focus on the root cause__ | Feel anxious and nervous when making purchase due to high cost, and then reconsider | Struggle during installation due to lack of necessary technical skills |
| __Be concise__ | Feel anxious during purchase about cost, and then reconsider | Struggle due to lack of technical skills during installation |
| __Use abbreviations sparingly__ | \-- | Struggle due to lack of _tech_ skills during installation |
| __Rely on context of map__ | anxious about cost / reconsider (depending on  your structure) | Struggle due to lack of tech skills / Lack tech skills (depending on  your structure) |

Consider different layouts for your diagram:

![Layout Types](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/mappingexperiencesoreillydesignconfpresentation-170321034534/95/mapping-experiences-oreilly-design-conference-2017-74-638.jpg)

Use a consistent representation

- Visual
  - Fit to space
  - Consider font selection
  - Color coding
  - Icons and shapes
- Text
  - Actions: Start each with a _verb_
  - Thoughts: Phrase as a _question_
  - Feelings: Use _adjectives_
  - Pain points: Start each with a _gerund_
  - Touchpoints: Use _nouns_
  - Opportunities: Begin with a verb of _change_ (_increase_ the ease of installation)

Focus possibly on _extreme_ use cases (Disabilities, 1st time visitors, children, etc.)

### Align & Envision: Make it Actionable

Host a workshop with the following structure:

Empathize :right_arrow: Envision :right_arrow: Evaluate :right_arrow: Plan Experiments

It's important to force conversation, make revisions in an open setting. When you make engagement happen, answers emerge. This should have at __least__ 4 hours devoted to it, but a full 1-2 days is optimal. This will not produce immediately actionable tasks for production. Use this to distill and flesh out models.

__Empathize:__ Pinpoint Opportunities:

- Gaps
- Weaknesses
- Efficiencies
- Competitors

Author Involvement Levels in the process.

__Envision:__ Articulate the ideas, storyboard them out, make sticky notes and move them around, create wireframes & prototypes.

__Evaluate:__ Evaluate the ideas. Attempt to trash them, disprove them, and eliminate them.

__Experiment:__ Ideas are overrated. We're already drowning in them. Consider giving people time to take ideas to a high fidelity product to discover the viability. Can it be designed? Can it be sold? Can it be marketed?

To create business value experiments, use a framework. Reference [The Innovator's Hypothesis; How Cheap Experiments are Worth More Than Good Ideas](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hypothesis-Cheap-Experiments-Worth/dp/0262028360).

Give a diverse team of [x] number of people:

-\ [\x] number of days
- to create [x] business experiements
- costing no more than $[x] and
- taking no longer than [x] weeks to run
