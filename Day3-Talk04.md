### Survivorship Bias

Survivorship bias leads us to have overly optimistic beliefs about how the world works. We analyze and emulate success to become successful instead of having a humble and self-reflective approach. The former rewards us, so we ignore the latter.


### Cracking the Code

Dialog may spans cultures sometimes within a single interaction. There's a cultural code we work to uncover as researchers to inform our decisions. This involves bending or breaking rules (often by accident) to discover them - and requires patience and creativity.

### Control is an Illusion

When control is on display, typically one is very near _losing_ control. We fail if we believe we can anticipate and design for anything. We lose ourselves in the illusion even if we are properly prepared.

### Judging and Learning

You're allowed to fail, expected to fail, and in fact, it is desirable to fail.

> To research is to be Human

> We're wired for story. In a culture of scarcity and perfectionism, there's a surprisingly simple reason we want to own, integrate, and share our stories of struggle. We do this because we feel the most alive when we're connecting with others and being brave with our stories.
> \- Bren√© Brown, Rising Strong

Share your stories of failure to normalize the flow of work. Vulnerability is not weakness; it's our greatest measure of courage.

Make decisions that draw from your code of ethics and don't create dependency. Though trained to empathize, we should not allow our emotions to dictate our inferences. Just by observing something, you may have changed it (Oppenheimer). Causing reflection can create lasting impact. Ensure informed consent - help to facilitate a transition into understanding without overstepping a boundary.

## How We Apply It

While somewhat vague and not necessarily a one-for-one experience application, we learn things from these war stories that we can certainly apply to how we might conduct both internal and external interviews as part of our user experience mapping (that we ought to be doing).

We might approach an elderly woman in a store differently than we would a parent with their child. Our language and presentation would change between interviewing a Sheetz manager and a Sheetz member of the board.

Considering these differences and how best to get the answers we need to move forward and benefit each party while getting the most accurate data possible is very important, though we shouldn't stop doing this kind of research just because we screw up something that we didn't foresee as a cultural difference.
