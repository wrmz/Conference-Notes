# Explore, Persuade, Destroy: Storyboarding for Product Development

__Speaker__: Abi Jones, Interaction Designer at Google Fiber, illustrated _"Understanding Your Users"_

## Takeaways

- Structure stories as a test for product needs
- Change focus from features to user goals

---

### Empathize With the Customer

Use empathy maps to conceive of customers that match perhaps your broader-spectrum target. It's easier to relate to "Amy" or "Jack" than it is to relate to "younger working-age females with families who have a propensity towards health".

Create empathy maps by giving an individual a name, a face, and considering the following:

- What do they think & feel?
- What do they hear?
- What do they see?
- What do they say & do?
- What is their main pain point?
- What do they stand to gain?

### Creating the Story

Use the dramatic story arc to create the user's experience and help illustrate the problem we want to solve.

- What is the situation?
- What is the incident in which they need us?
- What is the complication keeping them from accomplishing what they need?
- Where can we step in to reverse the issue and bring them to resolution?

### Structure Your Story

When creating a story around a user and their experience, consider these questions:

- What is it?
- When do I use it?
- Why should I care?
- How does it work?

Sketch out the story in the span of 8 boxes:

- 3 for the Problem
- 3 for the Solution
- 2 for the Benefit

### Give the User an Emotion

This helps stakeholders and the team alike empathize with the user they are looking to help and invests them in solving their problem.

## How We Apply It

We've done storyboarding to a small extent in some of the discovery meetings we've had with the ShOP team. I don't think we need necessarily to take it beyond that, but I do think that giving our user a name and a face allows us to refer back to them when considering the data we've collected and when we envision their experience together. This is an important part of mapping a user's experience which we absolutely should be doing, but should not become the project itself.
