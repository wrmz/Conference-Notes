## Takeaways

- Machine learning doesn't eliminate the need for designers
- Designers can harness and guide machine learning to streamline their own process

### Design Tools & Machine Learning

Ease of use does not imply ease of expertise. We have an innate sense of aesthetics in all of us. Design tools shouldn't just help us consider the constraints and commands we already have, but also help us learn __new__ constraints and commands. Designers should lead the tool, not the other way around. Machine learning is simply the tool, aiding the designer by predicting the next array of possible actions, and supporting the design by making the process smarter. We discover the constraints via experimentation and find ways to remove the constraints that bind, and add them where guidance is necessary.

An analogy between tools:

| iMovie | Final Cut Pro |
| More reaching constrained (fewer) options | More robust, small feature sets |

## How We Apply It

We should firstly be making sure we're using the correct tools. Additionally, we ought to be modifying anything "out of the box" defaulted by any kind of "filter". (These get outdated and overused quickly)
