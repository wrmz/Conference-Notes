__Speaker__: Daniel Soltis, UX Director at Moving Brands

## Takeaways

- Consider the brand as an experience for the user

- Be willing to put in time to create tools, toolkits, and best practices for leaner and more consistent work in the future

### What is a Brand

- Not just a logo & color
- Everything about an organization
  - Experiences we have with it
  - What is said & done
  - Ex: Nintendo is something to me that Nintendo didn't design
- Identity System
  - _Raw materials_ to make things
  - Logo, type (look & feel)
  - Tone of voice
  - Sound & movement
  - Interaction patterns
- Strategy
  - Ideas behind the brand
  - Who you are
  - Who you are for
  - What makes you different
  - What you're trying to do in the world

### What is UX Design

Brand identities have multiple audiences with very different needs and contexts.

__Stakeholders__ :arrow_right: via an :arrow_right: __Identity System__ :arrow_right: use :arrow_right: __Practitioners__ :arrow_right: to create :arrow_right: the __Everything__ experience :arrow_right: for :arrow_right: __Audiences__

### Bringing it Together

A brand identity system is a toolkit. A toolkit should:

- Be useful
- Be Usable
- Help people get where they're going

Create a successful toolkit by following these guidelines:

- __Prototype early and often__
  - How will the identity work in context?
  - How might it flex to new contexts?
  - How can you stretch your thinking?
- __Lean into constraints__
  - How can practical challenges shape the system and make it better?
- __Make tools, not rules__
  - How to share solutions to problem's faced?
  - Could this be automated?
  - Could there be a tool to make this easier?
- __Put best practices into practice__
  - What best practices should be built into the system?
  - How can general guidance be translated into a specific context?
- __Build toolkits rather than rulebooks__
  - How to get practitioners what they need when they need it
  - How to enable guidance to evolve and stay up to date?
- __Demonstrate the art of the possible__
  - What are the intangibles that need to be shown rather than told?
  - How to inspire?
