So, what can she do that provides value?

- Faster, easier, more enjoyable
- Far field
- Low information density

### Craft

There aren't many voice designers on the market. The ones with experience have already been scooped up by Amazon, Google and Apple. There is a real need for designers in this market. This is __not__ a "no UI" or "zero interface" field.

Words are a complex medium with tangible design elements:

- Prosody
- Anaphora
- Discourse markers
- etc.

How does one make meaning happen within the context of voice? Consider the following sentence:

> I really need to see you

The way this is spoken can change the meaning entirely with a lot of depth

Ask yourself:

- What are interactions that make sense?
- What are people likely to say?
- What information is required or helpful?
- How does dialogue need to be managed?

There are other factors too:

| - | - |
| Discoverability | Context sensitivity |
| Cognitive load | Memory |
| Organization | Perceived efficiency |
| Real-world language | Error recovery |

with analogous concepts to design principles:

| - | - |
| Color | Prosody and word choice |
| Line | Markers |
| Shape | Transitions |
| Contrast | Word emphasis & density |
| Controls | Key words & phrases |

Alexa skills are basically just miniature conversations that developers & designers have created. When designing these conversations, a workflow is still neccessasary.

1. Listen to how people talk; deconstruct
2. Ask "Why that now?"
3. Write dialogue and try it out with others
4. Observe responses and interpretations
5. What feels right? Off?
