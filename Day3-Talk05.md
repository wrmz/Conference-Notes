### What is Service Design

Service design is front & back of house; design for the people creating/providing the service _as well as_ the end recipient. It's participatory.

### Business Process Re-engineering (BPR)

The process of business should follow the flow of logistics. Organizations were able to streamline their costs by optimizing their flow. We should apply the same thinking to the customer's journey. Follow the customer's process - User Experience Maps are absolutely necessary. User experience maps are the answer to [boundary objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_object) that stop us from communicating an experience.

Take a person from an A to a Z. Consider a customer's journey, and you'll make the customer a better person in the sense of self, as well as creating a better customer.

### Flow

Flow matters if you see it. Seeing though, isn't doing. We're bad at seeing flow because we instead think from a product standpoint.

> Example:
> Coffee as a product is cheap. But coffee as a service isn't always. People are willing to pay more for coffee on the go than the coffee they buy at the grocery store. It's why Starbucks can even exist.

Services are a huge part of the US economy.

1. Flow is conversion. It has economics
    * A flow can be mapped to a funnel graph
    * Decisions can be made around the flow by improving benefits where they are needed
    * Marketing just increases the funnel (__but investment goes away over time__)
    * Improving the process instead makes the value last longer
2. Flow changes the landscape
    * Recommendation language as customer satisfaction is what allowed [Enterprise](https://www.enterprise.com/en/home.html) to grow
        - Would you recommend us (after service is rendered)?
    * Loyalty vs. Satisfaction
        - Look at return customers vs advocation for service
    * People don't remember much (Peak End Rule)
        - They remember the peak (best moment)
        - They remember the trough (worst moment)
        - They remember the end
    * Improve your experience by:
        - Removing the troughs
        - Embelish the peaks
        - Maximize the end
        - But don't make it uniformly good (peak level wouldn't change, making you less memorable)
3. No one person changes the flow
    * Look at customer actions, touchpoints, people involved, support processes
        - Example: Move something from behind the line of visibility to the fore (Subway, etc.)
    * It takes lots of different people to change one small service
4. Social networks affect the organization
    * Problems can be solved by incorporating processes wherein communication must occur
5. Scale brings complexity
    * Reach different customer segments, servicing different personas
    * We can't be something different to _everyone_
        - Find the overlap (core value proposition)
        - Provide a reason to engage
        - Ensure there is a payoff to the service
        - Create one baseline from 6 variations for example, meant for different kinds of customers

### Erasing the Troughs

The first thing to concentrate on are the troughs. People tend to remember bad experiences over good ones, so embellishing the peaks first won't have as much effect.
Turn the low moments in the customer experience into either a smoother movement or a dip with less depth.
Sometimes, completely removing the step that causes a trough altogether helps to improve the customer journey.
