## Takeaways

- Increase access and remove friction for the excluded
- By so doing, convenience and accessibility will be brought to everyone

---

### Diversity

Allow your goal to be:

> Empower every person and every organization __on the planet__ to achieve more

But there are a lot of different types of people, so focus on 1-1 interactions with a mind, heart & body.

### Definition of Disability

The World Health Organization defines disability as:

> Context dependent rather than as an attribute of a person

Rather than seeing disability as a personal health condition, we ought to see it as mismatched human interactions.

### Inclusion is an Engine for Innovation

Let inclusion drive your solutions. Human beings have a relentless drive to interact with each other. Don't design one thing for all people. Design a diversity of things so everyone finds a way to participate.

### Principles of Inclusive Design

1. Recognize Exclusion
  - Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases
  - Who are we designing for, who gets excluded?
  - When you design for everyone, you wind up designing for none
  - Look at the cognitive, physical and social functions instead of the person
2. Learn from diversity
  - Look at how people have adapted to their diversity
  - Look at successful designs that have incorporated these ideas in unique ways
    - From pill bottles, to weekly pill separators, to pill packets with clearly marked date, time and contents for consumption
3. Solve for one, extend to many
  - Focus on what's universally important to all humans
  - Design for a persona spectrum
    - Ex: Who benefits from subtitles & captioning?
      - Hard of hearing
      - Reading in an airport
      - Teaching a child to read
    - We all experience exclusion in more ways than ever

| | Permanent | Temporary | Situational |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Touch | One arm | Arm injury (in cast) | New parent (holding child) |
| See | Blind | Cataracts | Distracted driver |
| Hear | Deaf | Ear infection | Bartender (in noisy environment) |
| Speak | Non-verbal | Laryngitis | Heavy accent |

Who else wants to participate, but is excluded on a temporary or situational basis?
