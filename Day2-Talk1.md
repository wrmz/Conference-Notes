## Takeaways

- Increase access and remove friction for the excluded
- By so doing, convenience and accessibility will be brought to everyone

---

### Diversity

Allow your goal to be:

> Empower every person and every organization __on the planet__ to achieve more

But there are a lot of different types of people, so focus on 1-1 interactions with a mind, heart & body.

### Definition of Disability

The World Health Organization defines disability as:

> Context dependent rather than as an attribute of a person

Rather than seeing disability as a personal health condition, we ought to see it as mismatched human interactions.

### Inclusion is an Engine for Innovation

Let inclusion drive your solutions. Human beings have a relentless drive to interact with each other. Don't design one thing for all people. Design a diversity of things so everyone finds a way to participate.

### Principles of Inclusive Design

1. Recognize Exclusion
  - Exclusion happens when we solve problems using our own biases
  - Who are we designing for, who gets excluded?
  - When you design for everyone, you wind up designing for none
  - Look at the cognitive, physical and social functions instead of the person
2. Learn from diversity
  - Look at how people have adapted to their diversity
  - Look at successful designs that have incorporated these ideas in unique ways
    - From pill bottles, to weekly pill separators, to pill packets with clearly marked date, time and contents for consumption
3. Solve for one, extend to many
  - Focus on what's universally important to all humans
  - Design for a persona spectrum
    - Ex: Who benefits from subtitles & captioning?
      - Hard of hearing
      - Reading in an airport
      - Teaching a child to read
    - We all experience exclusion in more ways than ever

| | Permanent | Temporary | Situational |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Touch | One arm | Arm injury (in cast) | New parent (holding child) |
| See | Blind | Cataracts | Distracted driver |
| Hear | Deaf | Ear infection | Bartender (in noisy environment) |
| Speak | Non-verbal | Laryngitis | Heavy accent |

Who else wants to participate, but is excluded on a temporary or situational basis?

## How We Apply It

As a convenience restaurant, we have a lot to gain from inclusive design. Our customers are about as diverse as they come. How would a person who is deaf know when their order number is called?

Our solution for that excluded group would benefit parents who are busy making sure their kids aren't wandering the aisles. It would provide aid for the older folks who just don't hear as well. And it would benefit people who just aren't paying attention, lost in their thoughts. How often have you had to check a number on a bag on the counter, or how often have the employees needed to repeat order numbers?

Design for many, by designing for one - the excluded. By opening up accessibility, we're enabling customers with temporary or situational exclusions to be included. Let's bump up our common-place convenience to kick-ass convenience.
