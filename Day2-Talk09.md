## Takeaways

---

### Purpose

Planning is the crowning achievement of human cognition. It's a learned behavior and isn't linear. The Aesop fable, _"The Ants and the Grasshopper"_ pointedly informs why it's so important to plan ahead.

> Planning is the art and science of envisioning a desired future and laying out effective ways of bringing it about.
> ---
> The purpose of __design__ is to achieve a greater understanding of the environment and the nature of the problem in order to identify an appropriate conceptual solution.

These are quotes from the _"Marine Corps Planning Process"_.

Strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position involving a different set of activities.
Operational effectiveness (_performing similar activities better than rivals_) is not strategy.
A sustainable strategic position _requires_ tradeoffs.

### 10 Planning Theses

1. Planning is impossible and essential (prediction, uncertainty)
2. Planning is making (false dichotomy, commitment, discipline)
3. Planning is a skill (we can get better, practice, understanding)
4. Planning creates possibility (autopilot, lever)
5. Plans are built on beliefs (models, research, experiments)
6. Strategies are built on options (habits as traps, awareness)
7. There is no one right way (preference, context, fit)
8. We must use experts wisely (gaps, tradeoffs, incentives)
9. Planning can be fun (meaningful goals, health, happiness)
10. We can plan a better future (technology, optimism, hope)

### Strategic Designers

> The dark matter of strategic designers is organizational culture, policies, market mechanisms, legislation, finance models, governance structures, tradition, habits.
> \- Dan Hill, _"Dark Matter and Trojan Horses: A Strategic Design Vocabulary"_

Strategic Designers:

1. Align with business strategy
    * Executives __must__ articulate their strategy
2. Shape digital & experience strategy
3. Help executives with planning

### Strategic Design Principles

We'll use the acronym __STAR__.

<strong>S</strong>ocial <br/>
<strong>T</strong>angible <br/>
<strong>A</strong>gile <br/>
<strong>R</strong>eflective

- __Social__
    - What (plan with people, early & often)
    - Who (family, friends, mentors, stakeholders)
    - Why (get started, better ideas, empathy, buy-in)
- __Tangible__
    - What (get ideas out of your mind-body)
    - Why (embodied cognition, extended mind, collaboration)
    - How (writing, sketching, modeling, prototyping)
    - _"How can I know what I think until I see what I say?" - E.M. Forster_
- __Agile__
    - What (plan for disruption, embrace change)
    - Why (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity)
    - How (Agile, Lean, improv, optionality, mindfulness)
    - _"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything." - Eisenhower_
- __Reflective__
    - What (question beliefs, methods, goals)
    - Why (human fallibility, context shifts, wisdom)
    - How (metrics, feedback, metacognition, meditation)

### Strategic Design Practices

We'll use the acronym __FINDER__.

<strong>F</strong>rame <br/>
<strong>I</strong>magine <br/>
<strong>N</strong>arrow <br/>
<strong>D</strong>ecide <br/>
<strong>E</strong>xecute <br/>
<strong>R</strong>eflect

- __Frame__
    - What (seeing problems, defining goals, designing process)
    - How (research, sketching, mental models, OKRs, impossible list)
    - If your beliefs are wrong, your planning might not work out so well
    - The truth matters
    - Goals can be valuable, but can also be dangerous
    - Not all goals are right
    - _"An essential function of planning is to promote understanding of the problem. Framing is the most important step." - Marine Corp Planning Process_
    - The harmful side effects of [over-prescribing] goal setting are far more serious and systematic than prior work has acknowledged
    - The use of goal setting can degrade employee performance, shift focus away from important but non-specified goals, harm impersonal relationships, corrode organizational culture, and motivate risky and unethical behaviors
    - One of the most common myths of agile software development is that agile teams don't plan. In fact, agile teams do a much more thorough job of planning than many traditional project teams
        - Short iterations
        - Pairing
        - Daily standups
        - Last responsible moment
        - Tests
        - Fail fast
        - Feedback
        - Reflection
- __Imagining__
    - What (expanding awareness of paths and possibilities)
    - How (research, mental models, counterfactuals, play, simulation)
    - Technology changes planning
- __Narrowing__
    - What (evaluating and filtering paths/options, estimates, risks)
    - How (research, COG analysis, planning poker, affinity estimation)
    - A novice researches by depth first (follows a path to the end before returning for another path to take)
    - An expert researcher researches by breadth first (looks at the options and compares/eliminates, before diving deeper)
    - Plans fail because of __tunneling__, the neglect of sources of uncertainty outside the plan itself
    - An __option__ makes you antifragile and able to benefit from the positive side of uncertainty, without a corresponding serious harm from the negative side
    - Have options since we can't predict the future - we're going to get it wrong
- __Deciding__
    - What (committing to and communicating a course of action)
    - Who (the "decider" / RACI - responsible, accountable, consulted, informed)
    - _"The (COA) course of action graphic and narrative portray how the organization will accomplish the mission. No more detail than needed; balance guidance + freedom (commander's intent). When writing plans or orders, words matter." - Marine Corp Planning Process_
- __Excuting__
    - What (making, building, traveling, getting things done)
    - How (systems, tools, feedback, mindfulness, motivation)
    - Progressive elaboration involves continuously improving and detailing a plan as more detailed and specific information and more accurate estimates become available
- __Reflecting__
    - Should be reflecting all the time, but always look back/within at the end and discuss what worked and what didn't
        - What you did
        - What worked
        - What you might do differently
    - _"People who as a matter of habit extract underlying principles or rules from new experiences are more successful learners than those who take their experiences at face value." - Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_
