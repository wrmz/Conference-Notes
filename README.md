# Conference-Notes
Notes from the O'Reilly Design Conference

This repository holds the notes from the most relevant talks from the conference that I feel Sheetz would get the most out of. Each file contains a "Takeaways" section outlining the most important artifacts of the talk or overarching theme. Additionally, at the bottom of every file there is a "How We Apply It" section detailing how I think what I learned would benefit Sheetz or how we incorporate the learning. If you want to pour through these notes, but don't want to read much, please skim at least these sections.

## Lessons Learned

If you don't want to read _any_ of it, I don't blame you. There's a lot there, so, in a nutshell, here is the compressed version of the most important things I'd like us to consider:

### Who Are Our Customers

We don't know enough about our customers. We also don't know enough about the stakeholders. What is their experience like? What are they trying to accomplish? What are their pain points? Are we aligned properly with our touchpoints and are we addressing the correct problems?

We need to conduct interviews. We need to talk to customers, yes, but also the employees in the store. Are they using work-arounds to get the desired result? What about the product owners and the stakeholders? What are they really trying to accomplish? Are we addressing their needs? Do they understand where the real problems are?

We __absolutely need__ to create experience maps and use them as devices to start conversations that matter. If you've read the notes on this one and still aren't convinced, let me know and I'll convert you (or bribe you - whichever works).


### Planning is Important

We need to spend more time in planning mode. We need to be willing to drop time upfront and spend an entire sprint or two finding and talking about our touchpoints and how we can improve the experience. And then we need to disprove them, test them, and analyze them until we have something solid to run with. We all ought to know what the plan is, who it's for, why they need it and where it's needed.

### We Need a Design System

A design system would ease interactions between marketing and brand and provide a world that we can both take part in. This is another time investment, but a very important one that will with 100% certainty make development faster in the long run. With a design system, we can all benefit:

| Discipline | Benefit |
| - | - |
| Designers | Have a consistent web/email/digital styleguide to work with and from (Typography, colors, patterns, logos, branding) |
| UI Designers | Have a controlled and stable guide for theming and creating |
| Developers | Have an immediate catalogue of pieces from which to draw on when developing with little to no extra effort |


End.
